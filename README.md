# GoodTimes

This plugin was created using `skpm`. For a detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the
 [skpm Readme](https://github.com/skpm/skpm/blob/master/README.md).

## How it works

Good Times works just like any other data plugin, except that before populating the text layers with times and dates,
 it checks the y-position of the layer or symbol, where an override is connected to the data supplier.

The plugin uses the standard javaScript date-functions, so the data is localized.
